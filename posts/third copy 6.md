Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

```ruby
this = "Ruby Code"
puts "This is #{this}"
```

```javascript
export default Function getTemplate(){
  return <h1> This is Template function </h1>;
}
```
